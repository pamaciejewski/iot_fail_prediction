# IoT Failure Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a neural network designed to predict failures in IoT (Internet of Things) devices based on collected data. The model leverages historical data from device sensors to identify potential failures before they occur, helping in preventive maintenance and reducing downtime. The solution is fully containerized using Docker, ensuring easy setup and consistency across different computing environments.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Scripts to clean, analyze and prepare data for training.
- **Neural Network Model**: A deep learning model built with Keras/TensorFlow to predict potential device failures.
- **Training Scripts**: Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for training the neural network model.
- **Evaluation**: Tools and scripts to evaluate the model performance.
- **Docker Integration**: Dockerfile included for building and running the project within a Docker container.
